            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THat when a Child of God dies, though his death be never ≈øo unnatural and violent, yet it is nothing el≈øe but a falling a≈øleep.</hi> Or, the death of a Child of God, though ≈øtoned to death, though burnt to a≈øhes, though it be never ≈øo violent and unnatural, is nothing el≈øe but a falling a≈øleep, <hi>When he had ≈øaid this, he fell a≈øleep;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Somnus e≈øt mortis imago,</hi> Sleep is the image of death. There are many notable re≈øemblauces betwixt ≈øleep and death, ≈øome of which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak unto at this time.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Sleep is common to all men, there is no man can live without ≈øleep. So it is true of death, death is common to all, it is <hi>appointed for all men once to die:</hi> And therefore <hi>David</hi> ≈øaid, He was to go the way of all fle≈øh, <hi>Statum e≈øt omnibus ≈øemel mori, Omnibus e≈øt calcanda ≈øemel lethi via,</hi> All men mu≈øt ≈øleep the ≈øleep of death, or el≈øe be changed, which is a metaphorical death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ≈øleep ari≈øeth from the vapours that a≈øcend from the ≈øtomach to the head, and tie the ≈øen≈øes, and hinder their operations; ≈øo death came into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden fruit, and by the poy≈øonful vapour of ≈øin, that brought death upon him, and all his po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>By one man ≈øin entred into the world, and death by ≈øin, and ≈øo death pa≈ø≈øed upon all men, for that all have ≈øinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. Had <hi>Adam</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øinned, <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øhould never have died: But <hi>in Illo die,</hi> ≈øaid God. <hi>In that day thou eate≈øt the forbidden fruit thou ≈øhalt die the death,</hi> Sin brings <hi>omnimodam mortem, all kinds of death; it brings death temporal, death ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and death eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As a man when he goeth to ≈øleep puts off his Clothes, and goeth naked into bed: ≈øo it is with us when we come to die; <hi>we came naked into the world, and we mu≈øt go naked out of the world;</hi> as we brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with us into the world, ≈øo we mu≈øt carry nothing with us out of the world: and therefore death in Scripture is called nothing el≈øe but an uncloathing of our ≈øelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. Death to a Child of God is nothing el≈øe but the putting off his Clothes.</p>
               <p>Beloved, when we come to die we ≈øhall be ≈øtript naked of three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 We ≈øhall be ≈øtript naked of all our worldly honour, riches and greatne≈øs.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:173123:4"/>
               <p n="2">2 We ≈øhall be ≈øtript naked of our Bodies: And</p>
               <p n="3">3 Which is above all, we ≈øhall be ≈øtript naked of our ≈øins, and that is the happine≈øs of a Child of God, he ≈øhall put off not only his mortal body, but the body of ≈øin.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In the fourth place ob≈øerve, as no man knoweth the time when he falls a≈øleep, a man falls a≈øleep before he is aware: ≈øo no man can tell the certain time when he mu≈øt die: There is nothing ≈øo certain as that we mu≈øt die, nothing ≈øo uncertain as the time when we ≈øhall die: Death comes ≈øuddenly, even as ≈øleep comes upon a man before he is aware:</p>
               <p n="5">5 Ob≈øerve, as Children and Infants, becau≈øe they do not know the benefit of ≈øleep, are very loath to go to ≈øleep; many times the Mother is fain to whip the Child to bed, even ≈øo it is with mo≈øt of Gods people, becau≈øe they do not ≈øtudy the benefit of death:</p>
               <p n="6">6 Ob≈øerve, as when a man is fa≈øt a≈øleep, he is free from cares and troubles; let it thunder, (as it thundred not long ≈øince, as you know) yet a man that is fa≈øt a≈øleep, while he is a≈øleep, he heares it not; let the hou≈øe be on fire, while the man is a≈øleep, he ≈øees it not, neither is he troubled at it: So when a Child of God ≈øleeps the ≈øleep of death, he doth not feel, nor is he ≈øen≈øible of any of the calamities, or ≈øad provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God upon the earth:</p>
               <p n="7">7 When a man goeth to ≈øleep, he goeth to ≈øleep but for a certain time, in the morning he awakes out of ≈øleep. So it is with the ≈øleep of death; and therefore death is called a ≈øleep, becau≈øe we mu≈øt all awake in the morning of the Re≈øurrection:</p>
               <p n="8">8 Sleep is a great refre≈øhing to tho≈øe that are weary and ≈øick, and when the ≈øick man awakes, he is more lively and chearful then he was when he fell a≈øleep; and therefore ≈øleep is called <hi>Medicus laberum, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegrasio virium, recreator corporum,</hi> The great Phy≈øician of the ≈øick body, the redintegration of mans ≈øpirits, the reviver of the weary body: And ≈øo it is with death, when Gods people awake out of the ≈øleep of death, they ≈øhall be made active for God, then ever they were before; when you lie down in the grave, you lie down with mortal bodies; <hi>It is ≈øown a mortal body, but it ≈øhall ri≈øe up an immortal body; it is ≈øown in di≈øhonour, but it ≈øhall ri≈øe up in honour; it is ≈øown a natural body, but it ≈øhall ri≈øe up a ≈øpiritual body:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 As in the morning when we ari≈øe out of our beds, we then put on our Clothes: So in the morning of the Re≈øurrection, we ≈øhall put on a glorious body, like to the glorious body of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> we ≈øhall put on <hi>Stolam immortalitatis,</hi> the Garment of immortality:</p>
               <p n="10">10 As no man when he layeth him down to ≈øleep, knoweth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173123:4"/>time when he ≈øhall awake, ≈øo no man can tell when the re≈øurrection ≈øhall be: They do but couzen you, who ≈øay, that the general Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ≈øhall be ≈øuch or ≈øuch a year; for, as no man can know the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute when he ≈øhall awake out of his natural ≈øleep, no more can any man know when we ≈øhall ari≈øe from the ≈øleep of death.</p>
               <p n="11">11 It is a very ea≈øie thing to awake a man out of ≈øleep, it is but jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him and you will quickly awake him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As when a man ari≈øeth in the morning, though he hath ≈ølept mary hours; nay, ≈øuppo≈øe he could ≈øleep 20 years together, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, when he awakes, the≈øe 20 years will ≈øeem to be but as one hour unto him: So it will be at the day of judgement, all tho≈øe that are in their graves, when they awake it will be <hi>tanquam ≈øomnus unius horae,</hi> but as the ≈øleep of an hour unto them.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, and mo≈øt e≈øpecially, as ≈øleep ≈øeizeth only upon the body, and the outward ≈øen≈øes, but doth not ≈øeize upon the ≈øoul, the ≈øoule of man is many times mo≈øt bu≈øie, when the man is a≈øleep; And God hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore revealed mo≈øt glorious things to his Children in dreams, when they have been ≈øleep; God appeared unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and many others in dreams, the body ≈øleeps, but the ≈øoul awakes a So it is with the ≈øleep of death, the body, that dies, but the ≈øoul doth not die.</p>
               <p>If ever you would ≈øleep an happy ≈øleep in death, then labour to work hard for Heaven while you live. On how delightful is ≈øleep to a weary man? When a man hath taken pains all the day, as the Traveller that hath travelled all the day, or the Plough man that hath been at work all the day, how quietly, how ≈øoundly doth he ≈øleep in the night? O Beloved! If ever you would ≈øleep an happy ≈øleep at death then labor to work out your ≈øalvation with fear and trembling, and give all dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your Calling and Election ≈øure. The more you labor for Heaven, the better, the ≈øweeter will your ≈øleep be when you come to die. And remember this, That as much ≈øleeping in the day time, will hinder a mans ≈øleep at night: So you that idle away the time of your providing for heaven in this your day, you that ≈øleep away the minute upon which eternity doth depend, you will take a ≈øad ≈øleep when deach ≈øeizeth upon you. Sin is ≈øuch a ≈øleep as brings the ≈øleep of death: Sin brings the fir≈øt death, and ≈øin brings the ≈øecond death, all mi≈øeries what≈øoever are the Daughters of ≈øin.</p>
               <p>If you would ≈øleep an happy ≈øleep, and have an happy awakening at the Re≈øurrection, then take heed of the ≈øleep of ≈øin, <hi>Awake thou that ≈øleepe≈øt, ari≈øe from the dead, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhall give thee life.</hi>
